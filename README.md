# ShefudaSwfitUI
> A Shefatullah Soundboard app for iOS
> Ported to SwiftUI

## Original Repo
https://github.com/ShawonAshraf/Shefuda

## Why though?
Recently someone took the generous task of creating sound clips from the famous/infamous facebook live video of Shefatullah and developed a soundboard app for Android. So I thought, why not one for iOS?

## Who is Shefatullah?
Seriously? You should commit Harakiri.

## Current number of Shefuda clips
**`201`**

## Platforms Supported

```json
{
  "minimum": "iOS 13.0"
}
```

## Dependencies
None.

## Running the project
First of all you need a mac with macOS and Xcode installed. No you can't do it on any other OS (not even on windows in bootcamp). Also you need to make sure your mac has macOS Mojave and has Xcode 10 or greater.

- Clone the repo or download as zip.
- `cd` into the folder with `Terminal`
- Open the `ShefudaSwiftUI.xcodeproj` file. (Opens in [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12))
- Run it on your device or simulator.

## Device Support
iPhone, iPad, Mac

## Download for macOS
You can download it from [here](https://github.com/ShawonAshraf/ShefudaSwiftUI/releases/tag/1.0-mac), unzip the file and then run the app. 

## Known Issues for the Mac Version
The share button isn't fully implemented for macOS yet. 

## Side loading on your device
You can do that from Xcode. Just make sure you have your Apple ID. You can follow this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/VvrBbBjP-Hs) or [this one](https://youtu.be/bpyslMcAsgs).
